Simple Notepad on Java language (电子科技大学Java语言论文)

Key features:
- Open / Save file (txt / rtf format)
- Hotkeys
- Edit notification + undo function
- Search function (kinda same as TextEdit on Macs)
- Text formatting (text color, text background color, notepad background)
- Text formatting can be saved when saving in rtf format
- File can be rewrited, can be saved as new file (user selects what to do)
- Save file dialog comes out, when you trying to exit app without saving or trying to open new file while opened file was modified
- Popup message at the screen let's you know what you have done


P.S. I was studying java for 5 months in university, made this small app for my Grandpa (soon will translate it to Russian and publish another branch) <3
